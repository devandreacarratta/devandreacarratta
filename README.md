## Andrea Carratta

With over twenty years of experience, my expertise spans from **design to the realization of complex solutions.** Just like tackling a puzzle such as the Rubik Cube, programming and cloud architecture present intricate challenges that require a robust strategy and a precise methodology.

I assist companies in optimizing their IT architecture, guiding them through the complexities of the technological landscape, pinpointing scalable solutions, and implementing strategies based on the industry's best practices. **This approach not only ensures efficiency and resilience but also a significant reduction in operational costs.**

Every decision, from algorithm selection to benchmarking, **ensures that companies derive the maximum value from their technological investment.**
